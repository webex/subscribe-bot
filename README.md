Once this repository has been cloned, you must run `git init` from the root directory, then run `npm start` to run the demo. Be sure to modify lines 11-14 in `./app.js`. This section of code will be where you place your bot's info. The info will include the bot's token, the bot's webhook's target endpoint, the bot's personId, as well as the preferred port for the bot to use.
